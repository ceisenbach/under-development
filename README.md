# under-development
* A few sims undergoing development.
* Comments are **always appreciated**. Be they mistakes you have noticed or suggestions to optimize my code.

###Slope
[check it out](https://ceisenbach.github.io/under-development/slope/).
* This is a sim meant to illustrate the slope of line at any given point on along a function on a graph.

#####Goals:
* Have the user adjust the delta x, and see how the slope line is affected.
* A random function generator that changes the function each time the sim is loaded.

#####Needs to be done:
* Fix the slope line so it's mathematically **accurate!!!**.
* Fix the slope line so its smaller and follows the circle on the function. Instead of staying in middle of the page.
* Better modulation of the sim so that it can be adapted into other sims more effectively and will work with any arbitrary function given.
* Cleaner code, less inefficiencies, readability.

###Grid
* A grid that acts as a background for sims.
* This is a constructor function that I hope can be added to the science.js library.

#####Goals:
* **Consume as _little_ CPU as possible**.
* As much power given to the user. 
 * Size.
 * Color.
* Potentially have two versions.
 * A version like the one now.
 * A ```createGraphics();``` version.

###Angular-Motion:
[check it out](https://ceisenbach.github.io/under-development/angular_motion/).
* A sim that allows the user to change the angular acceleration.
* Any ideas for what it can be used for are _welcome_.

###Rise-O-Run:
* A sim that allows the user to create a linear function.

###Energy: _has not been posted yet_
* A sim using the [box2d phyics engine - js port](https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js/).
* It's meant as an illustration of stable and unstaple equilibrium on an energy graph
* As you can most probably see that it has a lot of potential for expansion into other phyics concepts.

#####Goals:
 * incorporate tilt-event ```rotationX``` 
 * cooler looking -\'_'/-
