# under-development
* A few sims undergoing development.

* Comments are **always appreciated**. Be they mistakes you have noticed or suggestions to optimize my code.

###Slope

* This is a sim meant to illustrate the slope of line at any given point on along a function on a graph.
#####Goals:

* Have the user adjust the delta x, and see how the slope line is affected.

* A random function generator that changes the function each time the sim is loaded.

#####Needs to be done.
* fix the slope line so its smaller and follows the circle on the function. Instead of staying in middle of the page.

* Better modulation of the sim so that it can be adapted into other sims more effectively and will work with any arbitrary function given.

* Cleaner code, less inefficiencies, readability.
